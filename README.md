# Getting Started with Machine Learning

This is an Introioudctions to Machine Learning with a simple imaginary Shopping Company's Dataset

## Overview

AI is used to Building smart machines capable of performing tasks which typically require human intelligence

## Machine Learning

* ML is Subset of AI
* We build a Model or an Engine and give to model with loads of data
* Model will then find and learn patterns in the input data
* It will then predict with a certain level of accuracy
* The more input data we gave, the more accurate the model will be


## Applications

* Self-Driving Cars
* Robotics
* Language Processing
* Vision Processing
* Forecasting Stock Market Trends
* Weather
* Games and so on

## Machine Learning Process 

	1. Import Data
		a. Often CSV
	2. Clean the Data
		a. Removing duplicates
		b. Noise
	3. Split the Data into Training/ Test Sets
	4. Create a Model
		a. Algorithms
			i. Decision Trees
			ii. Neural Networks 
			iii. Libraries: scikit learn
	5. Train the model
	6. Make Predictions
	7. Evaluate and Improve
		a. Optimize and Finetune
		b. Modify the partameters
		c. Change the Algorithm
	

## Libraries and Tools

	1. Numpy
		a. Provides Multi Dimensional Arrays.
	2. Panda
		a. Data Analysis Library
		b. Dataframe - rows and columns
	3. MathPlotLib
		a. 2 Dimensional Plotting Library
	4. Scikit-Learn
		a. Popular Machine Learning Library Provides common Algorithms
		b. Decesion Trees
		c. Neural Networks
	5. Jupyter
		a. Anaconda Platform
